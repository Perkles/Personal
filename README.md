# Portfolio/blog with Django
#### General Notes

A personal blog developed using Django 2.0.1

If somehow you got here, please consider that this project is developed for Python's newbie and the code should not be a exemple.

#### Origin

This project is a rebuild of an old project of mine who follows the same intent. You can check the code of it in the branch [old-porfolio](https://github.com/Perkles/portfolio-django/tree/old-portfolio) and acces a live [demo](http://otaviocha.pythonanywhere.com/) if you want. Keep in mind that this live demo is related to the **old-portfolio** and is kind of a lame :poop: dont judge me.

- [Pillow == 5.0.0](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
